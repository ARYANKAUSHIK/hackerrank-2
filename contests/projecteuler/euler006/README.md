Project Euler #6: Sum square difference
=======================================

The following [problem][HRP] is from [Hacker Rank][HR]:

This problem is a programming version of [Problem 6][PEP] from [projecteuler.net][PE]

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385. 
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025. 
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ***N*** natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Input
-----
First line contains ***T*** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by ***T*** lines, each containing an integer ***N***.

Output
------
For each testcase, print the required answer in a newline.

Constraints
-----------
1 ≤ ***T*** ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>  
1 ≤ ***N*** ≤ 10<sup>4</sup>

Sample Input
------------
	2
	3
	10

Sample Output
-------------
	22
	2640
