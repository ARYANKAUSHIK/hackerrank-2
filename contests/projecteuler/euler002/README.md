Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers
========================================

The following [problem][HRP] is from [Hacker Rank][HR]:

This problem is a programming version of [Problem 2][PEP] from [projecteuler.net][PE]

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,...***

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Input Format
------------
First line contains ***T***, followed by ***T*** lines each containing ***N***.

Output Format
-------------
Print the required answer for each test case.

Constraints
-----------
1 ≤ ***T*** ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>

1 ≤ ***N*** ≤ 4 x 10<sup>16</sup>

Sample Input
------------
    2
    10
    100

Sample Output
-------------
    10
    44
